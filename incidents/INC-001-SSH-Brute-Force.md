## Executive Summary

A brute force attack targeting SSH services was detected on the ubuntu-desktop endpoint. The attack originated from an internal IP address (10.0.0.34) and attempted to authenticate using the username "admin" with multiple password combinations. The attack was detected in real-time by Wazuh SIEM, investigated, and contained through firewall blocking within approximately 10 minutes. No successful authentication occurred.

| **Target Service** | SSH (Port 22) |
| **Target Username** | admin |
| **Attack Tool** | Hydra v9.5 (Password Cracking Tool) |
| **Total Alerts Generated** | 90 security events |
| **Authentication Result** | ✅ **FAILED** - No credentials compromised |

## Incident Timeline

| Timestamp | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 15:52:35 | Attack initiated - Hydra brute force started from 10.0.0.34 |
| 15:49:49 | First alert generated in Wazuh SIEM (Rules 5758, 5710) |
| 15:53:14 | Attack terminated - SSH rate limiting blocked further attempts |
| ~15:55:00 | Investigation completed - Attack classified as True Positive |
| ~16:00:00 | Containment executed - UFW firewall rule added to block 10.0.0.34 |

## Response Actions Taken

### 1. Detection & Triage
- Identified multiple authentication failure alerts in Wazuh SIEM dashboard
- Filtered events by agent (`ubuntu-desktop`) and rule IDs to isolate the incident
- Noted the spike in authentication failures indicating automated attack

### 2. Investigation
- Analyzed alert details to identify source IP (10.0.0.34)
- Confirmed target system (ubuntu-desktop) and service (SSH)
- Identified attack pattern: rapid successive login attempts with common passwords
- Verified no successful authentication occurred

### 3. Classification
- Classified as **TRUE POSITIVE** - confirmed malicious activity
- Attack matched MITRE ATT&CK technique T1110 (Brute Force)
- Volume and velocity of attempts indicated automated tool usage

### 4. Containment
Implemented firewall block on target system:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw deny from 10.0.0.34
sudo ufw status
```

#### Containment Evidence
<!-- Add screenshot of UFW status showing the deny rule -->

*UFW firewall rule blocking attacker IP*

### 5. Verification
- Confirmed firewall rule active via `ufw status`
- Verified subsequent connection attempts from attacker IP were blocked
- Continued monitoring for any related suspicious activity

## Response Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** | < 1 minute | < 5 min | ✅ Exceeded |
| **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** | ~10 minutes | < 15 min | ✅ Met |
| **Attack Success** | Prevented | N/A | ✅ No compromise |

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Attack Vector
The attacker utilized Hydra, an automated password cracking tool, to perform a dictionary attack against the SSH service. The attack targeted the "admin" username with a wordlist of common passwords.

### Why Detection Succeeded
1. **Wazuh agent** was properly configured on the target system
2. **SSH logging** was enabled and forwarded to SIEM
3. **Correlation rules** detected the pattern of multiple failed authentications
4. **Real-time alerting** enabled immediate analyst notification

### Why Attack Failed
1. **Strong password policy** - Target account password was not in attacker's wordlist
2. **SSH rate limiting** - Built-in SSH protection kicked in after multiple failures
3. **Rapid containment** - Firewall block prevented continued attempts

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Completed** - Block attacker IP via firewall
2. ⬜ Review all systems for similar attack patterns from same source
3. ⬜ Verify no unauthorized access occurred on any system

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Implement fail2ban** - Automatically block IPs after failed attempts
2. **Disable password authentication** - Use SSH key-based authentication only
3. **Configure Wazuh Active Response** - Automate IP blocking on detection

### Long-term Recommendations
1. **Network segmentation** - Limit lateral movement potential
2. **Remove unnecessary accounts** - Audit and disable unused usernames like "admin"
3. **Implement MFA** - Add multi-factor authentication for SSH access
4. **Regular security assessments** - Conduct periodic penetration testing
