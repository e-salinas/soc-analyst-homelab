## Executive Summary

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) detected suspicious files being added to the `/tmp` directory on the ubuntu-desktop endpoint. The files contain the EICAR test string, which is an industry-standard malware detection test. As a Tier 1 analyst, I triaged the alerts, gathered relevant file information including hashes, documented findings, and escalated to Tier 2 for malware analysis and remediation.

## Tier 1 Investigation Steps Performed

### 1. Alert Triage
- Identified FIM alerts in Wazuh Dashboard under Events tab and Discover
- Filtered by `agent.name: ubuntu-desktop`
- Noted 2 syscheck alerts related to `/tmp` directory

### 2. Information Gathering
- Expanded alert details to view file path and metadata
- Documented file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) for Tier 2 analysis
- Noted file owner, permissions, and timestamps
- Identified MITRE ATT&CK mapping (T1565.001)

### 3. Classification
- Classified as **True Positive** based on:
  - Unexpected file appearing in `/tmp` directory
  - File contains known test malware signature (EICAR)
  - No legitimate business reason for this file

### 4. Documentation
- Captured screenshots of alerts
- Recorded all file metadata and hashes
- Prepared escalation summary for Tier 2
